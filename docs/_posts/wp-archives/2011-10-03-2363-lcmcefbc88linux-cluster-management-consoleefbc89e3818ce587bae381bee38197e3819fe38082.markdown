DRBD-MCとしてリリースされていたLinux-HAのGUI環境ですが、この度、DRBD-MCからフォークしてLCMC（Linux Cluster Management Console）としてバージョン１．０．０リリースされました。

 


<blockquote>Good news everyone!<br>
<br>
I am happy to announce LCMC, Linux Cluster Management Console. LCMC is a<br>
Java GUI application that configures, manages and visualizes Linux clusters in a<br>
way that is not possible to be web-based. Specifically it manages clusters<br>
that use one or more of these components: Pacemaker, Corosync, Heartbeat,<br>
DRBD, KVM, XEN and LVM.<br>
<br>
If that sounds familiar, you are right, LCMC is a fork of DRBD MC, that<br>
unexpectedly passed away. Yes, I was surprised as you are, but after couple of<br>
minutes of mourning the untimely death as the developer of the DRBD MC, I<br>
decided to continue with it. I think I am not the only one to mourn it, other<br>
Pacemaker GUIs have a long long way to go and also this one is awesome.<br>
<br>
From the user point of view, LCMC is just a long needed name and design<br>
change, reflecting that the scope of the GUI is bigger than the DRBD, but<br>
DRBD as a small clever software that replicates disks, is still the central<br>
part of the GUI.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately as of now I am also not paid, not even badly to work on it,<br>
so don't expect me to add many new features for some time, but I am<br>
still maintaining it, waiting for support or suggestions to keep it running,<br>
the LCMC being in the low gear with my foot on the throttle, waiting to push<br>
it if needed.<br>
